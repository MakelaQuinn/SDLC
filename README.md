How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

- First step in interpreting the needs of a user/client is being a good listener and communicator. Without those skills you likely will not satisfy your client. But if you listen well and ask questions that offer clairity next you can create a user story. And the reason why stories are so great is becaus they are very consise and organized in displaying the customers desires to other members of the team with out them having to be present to receive all the details.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- Immediately Daily Scrums/Powwows they just seem to be great at ensure that  everyone meets and gets to converse breifly once a day before moving on to their own responsibilites within a project. Next, would be user stories once again I think its a great way to present the wishes of the customer to everyone and to ensure that their wishes are met and they are satistfied. Lastly, iterative development, I think it's a good practice because it keeps a team from creating large portion of code only to near the end realize none of it works together. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

- A good team member is many things but a few that work great regardless of whatever field you are in are: 
    Humility: No one is fond of working with someone with that is overly prideful or is unable to take critisim that comes form a genuine place.
    Responsibility: It's good to always have your deliverables on time but if something goes wrong, show good character by taking responsibility.
    Communicate: Be willing to respectfully add your input (good or bad), ask questions rather than sit and work for hours in confusion.
